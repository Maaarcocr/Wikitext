# Wikitext
This is a very little project I have made while attending UKGovHack 2016. I have used Twilio API in order to send texts programmatically. 
I have used a wrapper for Wikipedia API that have enabled me to get the first 1200 characters from a wikipedia page. 
I think that this may be a very interesting project if scaled, due to the fact that there are a lot of people in the world without internet connection
that may benefit from a service similar to this one.
